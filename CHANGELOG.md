# Changelog

## 2026-02-25 - St. John's Data Restored
The city added authentication to their plow tracking service, which broke our
data feed. We've worked around it by scraping the token from the city's own
public-facing map page and using that to authenticate. A great use of tax
payers' dollars putting a login wall in front of a handful of snowplow GPS
dots, but we're back in business.

## 2026-02-24 - Faster Coverage Rendering
Coverage playback and the heatmap view are now powered by [deck.gl](https://deck.gl), a GPU-accelerated visualization library. Time-lapse playback is noticeably smoother — the map no longer rebuilds thousands of line segments every frame, it just tells the GPU what time it is. Coverage lines now have rounded caps and a fade trail. Most importantly, **playback now works with all sources enabled** instead of requiring you to select a single source first.

## 2026-02-24 - Stale Data Indicators
The St. John's data source is currently experiencing technical difficulties on
the city's end. To make situations like this visible, the map now shows an
orange warning icon next to any source that hasn't received fresh data in a
while. Hovering over it tells you how long it's been. Vehicles that haven't
reported a position recently are also hidden from the realtime view so the map
only shows what's actually moving.

## 2026-02-23 - Ko-fi Support Button
A "Support me on Ko-fi" button now appears in the sidebar, if you'd like to
help keep the servers running.

## 2026-02-23 - Multi-Source Tracking
The map now tracks plows from Mount Pearl and the Provincial fleet alongside
St. John's. Toggle sources on and off from the legend, or zoom into a specific
city. Coverage playback is significantly faster.

## 2026-02-22 - Address Search
You can now search for a street address and jump directly to it on the map,
instead of scrolling and zooming manually.
